# SRPPI: Super-Resolution of Photoelastic Polarization Images Using a Neural Network and a Divide-and-Conquer Strategy



# **Overview**

The use of polarization cameras in digital photoelasticity has become increasingly prevalent, significantly contributing to the advancement of digital photoelasticity. However, polarization images captured by polarization cameras suffer from resolution loss, which severely affects the accuracy of the isochromatics and isoclinics. Therefore, it is essential to enhance the resolution of these polarization images. In this study, a super-resolution reconstruction network specifically designed for photoelastic polarization images is proposed for the first time.
